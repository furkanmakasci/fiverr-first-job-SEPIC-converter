1- Put input and output values, switching frequency .... to excel file
2- Take the output values and implement in real life or on simulation to see if the power stage can satisfied demanded power from output
3- If not, increase the power stage - inductors and capacitor values without changing compensator network until converter can supply required power
      -You can understand it --> After, attaching the load output voltage should stay the same.
      -You may not need to change coupling capacitor frequently, may be no benefit to it.
               -Keep other power stage values the same, increase coupling capacitor until you have the same decreased voltage after attaching load
