1- Put input and output values, switching frequency .... to excel file
2- Take the output values and implement in real life or on simulation to see if the power stage can satisfied demanded power from output
3- If not, increase the power stage values - inductors and capacitor values without changing compensator network until converter can supply required power
      -You can understand it converter can supply required power --> After attaching the load to output, output voltage or output voltage signal should stay the same after a short time
      -Why no need to change compensator network --> Because in this step we don't to worry about regulation, we worry if converter supply the power we require so don't need to change compensator network
       but, you can put hand input values and change compensation network according to new values every time you increase values
      -You may not need to change coupling capacitor frequently, may be no benefit to it
            -Keep other power stage values the same, increase coupling capacitor until you have the same decreased voltage after attaching load.
            -After you don't have different outcome, keep coupling capacitor values.
4- After output is stabilized
